# Validation
*****This program validate the propositional statement. It checks either you enter wrong syntax or right.
*****also It checks statement that you enter is true atleast once or not (all over the truth table)
*****For example : (1st part)
1:  (p12/\p34) is true and p12/\p34 is a false
2:  (~p34) is true
3:  (((p12/\(~p45) -> (p12/\p45)) /\ (p34/\p98)) is a true statement (note: you must have to double check scope of parentheses)

*****For example : (2nd part)
1:  (p12/\(~p12)) is false all over the truth table
2   (p12/\(~p45)) is true atleast once
3   (p12->(~p34)) is false all over the truth table
